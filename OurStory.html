       <p class="Parallaxtext">Kenna Littlefield is Level 9 gymnast at OOA Gymnastics and loves to coach, but is usually busy practicing.
        The summer after her freshman year of high school she knew she wanted to do something for her
        community and that she was very passionate about gymnastics. She also understood that gymnastics
        was expensive and because of this, unavailable to many families in the community. She came up with
        the idea of organizing and coaching a free gymnastics class and The Flips Project was born.</p>

       <p class="Parallaxtext">Over the next several months she was busy with planning. She contacted her friends from the gym and
        had a meeting with 30 potential volunteers. OOA Gymnastics graciously gifted her the use of their
        facility. She made a flyer and began working with FAN and reaching out to other community leaders for
        advice and marketing suggestions. The first class was the summer of 2018, which wasnâ€™t flawless but
        allowed for some great learning. Over the school year the class was restructured and began again in
        Spring of 2019. It continued smoothly through the summer and hopefully will continue to flourish
        throughout the year and for many to come.</p>

       <p class="Parallaxtext">We are currently looking to grow the program and spread the word through the website, flyers, and a
       social media presence. We are constantly looking for new volunteers to help with marketing, social media,
       and coaching. Our next steps towards the vision of increasing the accessibility to gymnastics is to be able
       to sponsor gymnasts to continue after the 8 weeks in recreational classes through OOA and possibly the
       competitive team. Sponsors and Donations from the community would make this possible.</p>
